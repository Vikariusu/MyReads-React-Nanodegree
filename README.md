# MyReads Project

### About
This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

MyReads app lets the user search for books (search limited to a particular set of [search terms](https://github.com/Vikariusu/MyReads-React-Nanodegree/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md)) and add them to user's lists: Currently Reading, Read and Want to Read. 
The app utilizes a mock API provided by Udacity.com.

### Get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
